Psf Test
==========================


This file provides detailed information on the Psf Test family
of fonts. This information should be distributed along with the Andika
Mtihani fonts and any derivative works.

Psf Test is a font family used only for testing the pysilfont framework.
It is not intended to be an installable font family and doesn't even
contain a complete Latin alphabet (Z and z are missing). The contents of
these fonts are taken from Andika New Basic (https://scripts.sil.org/andika).

For copyright and licensing information - including any Reserved Font
Names - see OFL.txt.

For practical information about using, modifying and redistributing this
font see OFL-FAQ.txt.
